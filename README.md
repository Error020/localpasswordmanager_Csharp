# localpasswordmanager_Csharp
I don't recommend using it. I only did it out of boredom. I will improve it with cryptography and cloud support soon.
I think I'll redo it in WPF.... honestly I only did it in WinForms because I was in bed with my laptop and kinda wanted to do it, but 
Visual Studio didn't perform that well with WPF on my laptop. 
Also, I kinda like WinForms....
