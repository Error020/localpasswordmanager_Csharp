I don't recommend using it. I only did it out of boredom. I will improve it with cryptography and cloud support soon.
I think I'll redo it in WPF.... honestly I only did it in WinForms because I was in bed with my laptop and kinda wanted to do it, but 
Visual Studio didn't perform that well with WPF on my laptop. 
Also, I kinda like WinForms....

However if you choose to use it either trust me and run the executable or build it yourself with Visual Studio.
You will probably have to unblock all of the .cs files in the "WindowsFormsApp1"-Folder.
To do that you simply right-click them in the Windows-explorer and check the "Unblock" checkbox at the very bottom of the properties window.

You'll need Visual Studio 2022 (2019 should also work) to build the executable.
